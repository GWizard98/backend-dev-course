# Module 02: Programming in Depth

## Objectives
- Deepen programming fundamentals via one of the supported language tracks
- Apply testing, error handling, configuration, and logging/tracing in practice

## Tracks
- Rust (Axum/Tokio)
- TypeScript (Node.js; Express or Fastify)
- Python (FastAPI or Flask)
- JavaScript (Node.js; Express or Fastify)
- Go (net/http or chi)

## Structure
- Each track has its own README under ./<lang>/ with local development commands and labs.
- Shared concepts are covered here; language-specific guidance lives in each track folder.

## Labs
- Implement the same exercises per track: testing, error handling, logging, configuration.
- See LABS.md for shared lab specs and acceptance criteria.

## Assessments
- Track-specific checkpoints and a common rubric across languages.
