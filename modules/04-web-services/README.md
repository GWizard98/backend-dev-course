# Module 04: Web Services

## Objectives
- Build RESTful APIs with routing, controllers/handlers, and validation
- Implement request/response schemas and basic OpenAPI docs
- Handle errors consistently; apply auth basics (sessions/JWT) at a high level
- Add lightweight logging and request tracing

## Prerequisites
- Module 01â€“03 (fundamentals, programming, data)

## Lecture Notes (outline)
- Routing and controller design; DTOs vs. domain models
- Validation strategies (schema-based, decorators, manual)
- Error handling patterns; problem+json; mapping domain errors to HTTP
- AuthN/AuthZ overview (sessions vs. JWT), secure password storage basics
- OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation; contract-first vs. code-first

## Labs
- See LABS.md for shared lab specs and acceptance criteria

## Assessments
- Quiz: HTTP semantics, validation, and auth basics
- Practical: implement and document a small REST API with validation and error mapping
